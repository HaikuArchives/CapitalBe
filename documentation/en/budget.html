<h1>Budget</h1>

<p>If you want to have extra money, you need a budget. While you are the only one who knows what is a good choice for the amount to put into each category, Capital Be gives you the tools to make the best decisions more easily.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/budget.png" alt="The budget window" /></p>

<p>There are four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="menu">Category list</span> - this lists each category, the amount set aside for it, and the period of time for which you are allocating the money, such as each week or month.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Budget editor</span> - making changes here will change the item you've chosen in the category list.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Information box</span> - displays information about the category selected in the category list. The information includes the biggest and smallest transactions and the average monthly spending over the past 12 months for the chosen category.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Budget summary</span> - shows what your budget looks like over the course of a year.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="budget" name="budget">How to make a budget</a></h2>

<p>When you open the <i>Budget</i> window for the first time, it automatically generates a budget for you, based on your spending for the past 12 months. This is only a starting point.</p>

<div class="box-warning">
<p>You get back to the auto-generated budget by clicking <span class="menu">Recalculate all</span> in the menu bar.<br />
This will remove any budget plans you may have entered!</p>
<p><span class="menu">Set all to zero</span> in the menu bar will erase all auto-generated or manually edited values!</p></div>

<p>Click on each item in the <span class="menu">Category list</span> for which you want to set aside money and type in the amount in the <span class="menu">Budget editor</span> on the right. Unless you've seen a significant change in your financial situation in the last year, choosing an amount which is just a little more than the average is a good idea unless the amount is not expected to change.</p>

<p>Make sure that there is some money left over to account for unexpected expenses &mdash; 5% of your monthly income is a good start.</p>

<div class="box-info">If you need more information than what the <span class="menu">Information box</span> can give, leave the <i>Budget</i> window open, go back to the main window, and open up the <a href="./reports.html">Reports</a> window. Placed side-by-side, you can easily see where you've been and plan where you're going.</div>
