<h1>Reconcile</h1>

<p>When it comes time to balance your checkbook, you will need to go here.</p>

<p>Many banks today group deposits together in one area on a statement, and expenses in another. CapitalBe does the exact same thing so you don't have to keep hunting around your statement.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/reconcile.png" alt="Reconcile window" /></p>

<p>To reconcile your account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the <span class="menu">Starting balance</span> and <span class="menu">Ending balance</span> in the top boxes with numbers from your bank statement.</li>
<li>If your bank imposed a service charge for something, such as an account maintenance fee, enter it into the <span class="menu">Bank charges</span> box.</li>
<li>If this account earns interest, put your monthly interest in the <span class="menu">Interest earned</span> box.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now all you have to do is double-click all the items in the lists below that you find on your statement. To indicate they're now accounted for, their text gets bold.<br />
When the number of deposits and charges add up to the difference between the <span class="menu">Starting balance</span> and <span class="menu">Ending balance</span> amounts, you're finished.</p>
<p>If you made a mistake, you can click <span class="button">Reset</span> to start over.</p>
<p>Click <span class="button">Reconcile</span> when everything is in order.</p>

<div class="box-info">Did you forget to punch something in? Do you need to correct an amount? Not a problem! Move the <i>Reconcile</i> window to the side and do what's needed in the main window. The <i>Reconcile</i> window will update itself and you can move on.</div>

<h2><a id="split-transactions" name="split-transactions">Quick balance</a></h2>

<p>The <span class="button">Quick balance</span> button can balance your checkbook with one click if all the deposits and charges before the statement date have cleared. When that happens, it will automatically reconcile your account, saving you all the clicking normally required to do that.</p>

<div class="box-info">Setting the <span class="menu">Date</span> at the top to the day of the most recent transaction on your bank statement will help <i>Quick balance</i> work more often.</div>
