The Report Window

This can be a powerful tool for you to find out just how and where you spend your money.

Report Types

Income / Spending - A breakdown of your income and spending by category.

Total Worth - How much money you have when your debts are weighed against your savings.

Subtotal

For any report, you can show totals for each month, quarter of a year, year, or just the total for the period of time that you have set for the report.


Categories

Reports can be run on just certain categories of transactions. If you hold the Shift key while clicking on the list, you can select multiple categories. You can select a range of categories by holding the Windows key and clicking on the list. If you want all categories, click on an item in the list and then press Alt+A.
